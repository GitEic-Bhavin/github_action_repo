**In this Repository we learned about**
- Create Workflows in .github/workflows/"your_yml_file.yml"
- Run Shell command using run
- Events Types & Filters Events
- Envets Controll for specific branches and specific folder or file path
- Skip workflow while your git commits msg contains [skip ci] or other official keyword.
- cancell workflow manually.
- write multiple jobs and steps in single workflows pipelines.
- Run 2nd Jobs after 1st Jobs completed using needs: "job_name" keywords.

- Bydefault if you dont specify needs: keyword , its working as **Run workflows Paralally**.

**Now, Next Topic will be Create Artifact and use That Artifact in second jobs.**
